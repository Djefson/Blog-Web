# MVC5-BlogEngine
A blogging engine developed with ASP.NET MVC 5

##Project URL: http://andquizi.azurewebsites.net/
*Note: the project URL above is on an Azure free trial account. The website loads pretty slow and once the trial expires the link will no longer work (around the beginning of February 2017). It also won't be completely up to date, but i'll update it on the weekends.*

#What is this?
- A simple project I am continually developing in my spare time to improve my skills with MVC 5
- Inspired from (okay, mostly copied from) [Medium](http://www.Medium.com)

#Features:
- Browse blog posts created by other users
- Create an account and create your own blog posts
- Blog posts can be featured by those who have the "Editor" role
- Blog tags 
- Blog comments 
- Favorite Blogs

#Todo:
- More editor features
- UX improvements
- Bug fixes (as I find them)
- New features (when I get new ideas)
