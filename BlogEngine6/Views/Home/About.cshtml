<h2>What is this website?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>This a pretty typical blog engine where users can create accounts and post personal blogs for anyone to read. It is very similar to how <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a> works.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" target="_blank">WYSIWYG</a> text editor <a href="http://ckeditor.com/" target="_blank">CKEditor</a> to allow users to format their blog posts anyway they like (but still make sure there are no XSS vulnerabilities!).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>I continue to incrementally add new features to this website to help me practise with ASP.NET MVC 5</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Why did I make this website?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>I created this website for one simple goal, to improve my skills with ASP.NET MVC 5 and the Microsoft framework.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>This project allows me to improve my skills with the Entity Framework (both code first and database first), database migrations, the Razor syntax, LINQ/Lamdba, and ASP.NET session and account management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
